This project further taught me how to write a macro script in Excel to automate tasks that would otherwise take a lot of time (repetitive, needle-in-haystack cases, math).

VBA is useful because it edits spreadsheets at speed and scale. It will not make a mistake from fatigue or mental fog like a weak human. Also, given how popular Excel is in business and basically any analytical domain, VBA gives an analyst/engineer the ability to help a broad array of organizations.
